A Responsive landing page

I was practicing Tailwind CSS by taking components and ideas from different sources such as DaisyUI,
 Flowbite UI, Mamba UI, W3Schools, and Google.

 
 I began attempting to execute a Figma design exactly as it was on the 18th. I experimented with different styles and visual effects throughout this process. I created multiple iterations before deciding on the one with the most polished appearance. I revised it and then separately pushed the final version to Git.


I've gained a lot of knowledge about Tailwind CSS and UI design through constant practice. I have benefited greatly from this practical experience.
